channels:

  # Do NOT include 'defaults' here for now. We'll rely on conda-forge and bioconda.
  # This often helps avoid channel priority conflicts that can make environments unreadable.
dependencies:
  # Explicitly specify the Python version you want.
  # Use the exact version, not the Snakemake config variable here, for maximum stability.
  # Colab is currently Python 3.10.x or 3.11.x. Let's pick 3.10 for broader package compatibility.
