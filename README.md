# üî¨ Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis: Cellular Aging in Mouse Skeletal Muscle

## Project Overview

This repository presents a robust and fully reproducible bioinformatics pipeline for the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The project specifically investigates **age-related cellular changes within mouse skeletal muscle**, leveraging publicly available data from NCBI GEO (GSE172410).

From raw gene count matrices to integrated data, clustering, and initial visualizations, this pipeline demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for complex single-cell transcriptomics studies.

### **3. Annotated Cell Types (Initial)**
Preliminary annotation of cell clusters based on key marker genes. (This will be further refined with biological insights.)

## üöÄ Reproducibility

The entire analysis workflow, from processed data input to final results, is encapsulated within a Snakemake pipeline, ensuring full reproducibility.

* **Data Source:** The raw data (GSE172410) is publicly available on [NCBI GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE172410). The processed input files for this pipeline are derived from this dataset.
* **Interactive Notebook:** A [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/[YourGitHubUsername]/[your-repo-name]/blob/main/analysis_workflow.ipynb) is provided within this repository, demonstrating how to execute the full pipeline step-by-step in a cloud environment.
